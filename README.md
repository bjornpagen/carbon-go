# carbon-go

https://carbon-go.io

currently documentation sucks. just look at the docs for carbon-design-svelte, i've tried
to keep it as similar as possible. the implementation is a direct port from svelte, although
we should try to keep upstream with the react version when possible.

i just didn't want to comb through react code.

will be adding doc comments.
