# carbon-go

https://carbon-go.io

currently documentation sucks. just look at the docs for [carbon design svelte](https://carbon-components-svelte.onrender.com/).
i've tried to keep it as similar as possible. moving forward,
we should try to keep upstream with the react version when possible.

i just didn't want to comb through react code.

will be adding doc comments.
